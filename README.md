<center><b>SOFTEC AIC 2024 TASK</b>

Provided with a dataset of labeled microscopic images categorized into two classes: "Mitotic" and "Normal" cells, the competition required us to develop a model which can accurately predict the classes of an unseen dataset.

# Overview

- The training dataset consists of 66 images.
- The training labels mention the image file name and the corresponding labels ('Mitosis' or 'Normal').
- The test data consists of 99 images, all unlabeled.
- OpenCV is used for most of the image reading, resizing, and preprocessing. To know more about what OpenCV does, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html).
- MultiOtsu is the primary preprocessing method used. To learn more about MultiOtsu, visit the [documentation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_multiotsu.html).
- We used Plotly and Matplotlib for visualizing our data.
- Using VGG-19, we trained our model. Here's the documentation for [VGG-19](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/).
